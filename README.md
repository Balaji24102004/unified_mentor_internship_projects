# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

This project is a classic machine learning classification task where the goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the famous **Iris dataset** which contains 150 observations of iris flowers with 4 features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

And a target variable:
- Species (`Iris-setosa`, `Iris-versicolor`, `Iris-virginica`)

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset.
- Visualize relationships between features.
- Train multiple machine learning models to classify the flower species.
- Compare their performance.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧪 ML Algorithms Applied

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Pairplots to show relationships between features
- Heatmap for correlation matrix
- Count plots of target labels
- Scatter plots with species coloring

---

## ✅ Results

- All models performed well; most achieved >90% accuracy.
- SVM and Random Forest showed the best overall performance.
